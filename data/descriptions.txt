Georgia vs Ball State Highlights (Ball State vs Georgia) | 2023 College Football Highlights. Georgia Football and Ball State Football played in week 2 of the 2023 College Football Season.

Covering sports in a unique way since 2018. 

If you‚Äôre looking for high quality sports content, then this is the channel for you! I‚Äôve covered Baseball (NCAA, LLWS, MLB), Football (NCAA, NFL), Softball (NCAA), Basketball (NBA, NCAA), Hockey (NHL), and much more!

The best part of my work as a YouTuber is being able to provide coverage of sports that may not receive as much attention as they should to the large audience I have built over the years. Many of the sports I cover aren't posted by any other YouTubers, which makes this channel that much more important.

One of my favorite accomplishments is revolutionizing the way sports channels create thumbnails. I've adopted two different styles, one with logos on the left and a game snapshot on the right, and the other with the logos in the middle and game snapshots representing both teams on either side.

I have a combined 4 years of experience as a Baseball & Basketball Play by Play announcer, which is where I learned my skills for commentary/breakdowns.

With the Seattle Seahawks injury news on Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas, the Seahawks are set to workout Jason Peters on Tuesday. Will Jason Peters be the solution the Seahawks are looking for at swing tackle? Meanwhile @chatsports host Tyler Jones says it is way too early to consider tanking for Caleb Williams in the 2024 NFL Draft. Jones also defends Geno Smith and says there is no need to bench him for Drew Lock on the Seahawks depth chart. However, the Seahawks did make a mistake not drafting Jalen Carter and selecting Devon Witherspoon in the 2023 NFL Draft. With the Seahawks‚Äô loss to the Rams, many believe that Seattle is the most troubling team of any playoff contender. If the Seahawks are going to compete this season, then the Seahawks secondary depth chart has to improve and Devon Witherspoon could potentially help that coming off of injury this week.

Stifled throughout the second half while producing a whopping 12 yards of offense in the final two quarters, the Seahawks couldn't get anything rolling on offense behind an injury-battered offensive line in a 30-13 loss to the Rams to open the season. Hosts Corbin Smith and Rob Rang break down what went wrong for Seattle in the second half after holding a slim halftime lead, how injuries to Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas could be potentially season changing for the franchise, and dish out their "Monday Musings" on offense, defense, and special teams revisiting Sunday's debacle at Lumen Field.

ABOUT THE SHOW: Patrick Peterson and Bryant McFadden have made a living for their coverage skills on the football field, and while it's a different technique, they're now applying those traits on their new podcast 'All Things Covered'. Instead of wide receivers, tight ends and running backs, they'll be covering sports, entertainment, social issues, personal interests and more. Every week, the 8-time Pro Bowler Peterson and 2-time Super Bowl champion McFadden will discuss what's happening on the gridiron as well as what intrigues them off the field. Each week they'll welcome a star from the sports and entertainment world to have wide-ranging conversations about what interests them. Guests can include active or former football players but also athletes and influencers from other sports and walks of life. Football is how we know our hosts, but far from what defines Pat and BMac. The name says everything; expect all things to be covered!

 Full replay of the Artistic Women's Beam Final from the North Greenwich Arena during the London 2012 Olympic Games. 

Artistic gymnastics was introduced at the very first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens, and has been present at every edition of the Games since then. At the beginning, it comprised disciplines that are difficult to qualify as "artistic", such as climbing and acrobatics.

The foundations of the Olympic gymnastics programme were laid at the 1924 Games in Paris, when the men's apparatus individual and team competitions appeared. In 1928, women were included in the Amsterdam Games. It was not until 1952 that the women's programme was developed, with seven events, and then stabilised at six events as from the 1960 Games in Rome.

Hi, my name is Timur. I'm professional 3d modeling artist. I make videos with Unity 3d and Blender software.

Here are the main steps how I create a video:
First of all I come up with a topic. Then I collect the necessary information from statistical sites, forums, discussions in various communities (All sources can be found below). Then I start assembling the scene. When the scene is ready, with the help of a neural network, I create unique cantileveres and make a preview. After this I'm looking for music on youtube creative studio or fair use sites. Finally I do video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects.

My videos are for entertainment purposes only.
Figures and facts at the time of creating video and watching it - may be strikingly different. Everything is purely individual. Don't forget about this.

About MLB.com:
Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.
 
Major League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.

The % chance to make playoffs and % chance to win division sections of the graphics are based on a model made by FanGraphs.com. I love their site and would definitely suggest checking out their graphs and models. The MLB section is very well made and is used in this video.

Covering sports in a unique way since 2018. 

If you‚Äôre looking for high quality sports content, then this is the channel for you! I‚Äôve covered Baseball (NCAA, LLWS, MLB), Football (NCAA, NFL), Softball (NCAA), Basketball (NBA, NCAA), Hockey (NHL), and much more!

The best part of my work as a YouTuber is being able to provide coverage of sports that may not receive as much attention as they should to the large audience I have built over the years. Many of the sports I cover aren't posted by any other YouTubers, which makes this channel that much more important.

One of my favorite accomplishments is revolutionizing the way sports channels create thumbnails. I've adopted two different styles, one with logos on the left and a game snapshot on the right, and the other with the logos in the middle and game snapshots representing both teams on either side.

I have a combined 4 years of experience as a Baseball & Basketball Play by Play announcer, which is where I learned my skills for commentary/breakdowns.

Covering sports in a unique way since 2018. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a place that can educate you with commentary on top of high quality edits, this is the place for you! I‚Äôve covered Baseball (MLB, NCAA, LLWS), Football (NFL, NCAA), Basketball (NBA, NCAA), Hockey (NHL), Softball (NCAA), and much more!

I make my videos on the HP Spectre x360. I use Adobe Premiere Rush to edit, which allows me to commentate and efficiently splice up clips in a high quality way.

One of my favorite accomplishments is revolutionizing the way sports channels create thumbnails. I started making them with team logos on the left, and a game snapshot on the right, and I‚Äôve gotten almost all of my video views with that style.

I have a combined 4 years of experience as a Baseball & Basketball Play by Play announcer, which is where I learned my skills for commentary/breakdowns.

Wake Forest Baseball and LSU Baseball played in a winner take all game at the College World Series to decide who gets to play against Florida in the 2023 College World Series Finals.

Since 1896, athletics has been on the programme of each edition of the Games of the Olympiad. Its presence on the Games programme has allowed its popularity to increase across the world. This popularity was also strengthened by the creation of the IAAF in 1912. Women's events appeared for the first time at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, while the men's programme was standardised as of the 1932 Games in Los Angeles. Although at the beginning women were authorised to participate in only some events, today their programme is almost identical to that of the men.

Brooks Koepka is the only LIV Golf player competing at the Ryder Cup, strange isn't it? This is the exact reason and I can't quite believe it. The real reason why only one LIV Golf player is competing in the Ryder Cup this month has come to light in the press today and I need to discuss it!! It is safe to say some golf fans were surprised at Zach Johnson's picks for U.S. Ryder Cup team. There was so much talk as to which Liv golfers, pga tour players, DP world tour players would feature in the 2023 Ryder Cup team and the US ryder cup team. Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka will be the only LIV Golf League player teeing it up at Marco Simone in three weeks' time.

The ryder cup team USA was announced last week and there are some surprising picks among the six captains that some golf fans are very surprise with. I think Zack Johnson has confused a lot of golfers and I think he could have gone down a different route but why did he only pick one liv golfer?

United States Ryder Cup Captain Zach Johnson today announced the six captains for the USA ryder cup, so many golf fans were asking would there be liv golfers in the USA ryder cup team, the us ryder cup, ryder cup teams and so much more!

The 2021 US Open main draw runs from August 30 - September 12 in New York City at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

Naomi Osaka is the women‚Äôs singles defending champion and will be aiming to claim the title for the third time in four years. Meanwhile, No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic looks to complete the calendar Grand Slam after winning the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon already this year. Should the Serbian lift the title here for the fifth time, he will also overtake Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to become the first-ever man to win 21 Grand Slam singles titles. With full capacity crowds back again, it‚Äôs time for the greatest return!

Qatar 2022 is at the and of this year. So I decided to create a compilation about the most iconic moments in the history of the World Cup. These moments are the most memorable from all of the World Cups there've been held over the years. We all remember the headbutt from Zidane in 2006. Which is one of the most iconic moments in football's history. This video is about such moments. Hopefully you enjoyed this video.

I've been wanting to do this video for a long time now, so I figured I might as well. This video includes all of the Stanley Cup winners from 1990 - 2017. It shows the final seconds, the end of the game, and initial celebration. I tried to use clips no shorter than 30 seconds, but no longer than 1 minute, depending on the footage I had available or if there was a good ending point. 

I decided to add the titles before each video clip, rather than during the video clip, because I don't like when there is text over videos. I did this despite adding over 1:30 of titles. So sorry for that. 

Also regarding the titles I put the final score/ games won of that finals series - 

Example: Edmonton Def. Boston 4-1 

For reference that is the final score of the best of 7 (First team to 4 wins) playoff series, and not the final game score. 

All the Stanley Cup Winners in order: 
00:08 - 1990 - Edmonton Def. Boston 4-1
00:40 - 1991 - Pittsburgh Def. Minnesota 4-2
01:23 - 1992 - Pittsburgh Def. Chicago 4-0 
02:14 - 1993 - Montreal Def. Los Angeles 4-1
02:50 - 1994 - New York Rangers Def. Vancouver 4-3
03:24 - 1995 - New Jersey Def. Detroit 4-0
04:05 - 1996 - Colorado Def. Florida 4-0
04:48 - 1997 - Detroit Def. Philadelphia 4-0
05:28 - 1998 - Detroit Def. Washington 4-0
06:07 - 1999 - Dallas Def. Buffalo 4-2
06:47 - 2000 - New Jersey Def. Dallas 4-2
07:42 - 2001 - Colorado Def. New Jersey 4-3
08:39 - 2002 - Detroit Def. Carolina 4-1
09:24 - 2003 - New Jersey Def. Anaheim 4-3
10:10 - 2004 - Tampa Bay Def. Calgary 4-3
11:00 - 2005 - NHL LOCKOUT - NO SEASON
11:05 - 2006 - Carolina Def. Edmonton 4-3
11:56 - 2007 - Anaheim Def. Ottawa 4-1
12:36 - 2008 - Detroit Def. Pittsburgh 4-2
13:32 - 2009 - Pittsburgh Def. Detroit 4-3
14:24 - 2010 - Chicago Def. Philadelphia 4-2
14:58 - 2011 - Boston Def. Vancouver 4-3
15:37 - 2012 - Los Angeles Def. New Jersey 4-2
16:20 - 2013 - Chicago Def. Boston 4-2
16:57 - 2014 - Los Angeles Def. New York Rangers 4-1
17:44 - 2015 - Chicago Def. Tampa Bay 4-2
18:26 - 2016 - Pittsburgh Def. San Jose 4-2

When owner Bill Foley was awarded an NHL expansion team, he said his goal was for the Vegas Golden Knights to win a Stanley Cup by their sixth season.

That came true on Tuesday night as the Golden Knights routed the Matthew Tkachuk-less Florida Panthers 9-3 to capture the franchise's first NHL championship.

The Panthers had pulled off upset after upset to reach the Final, but fell to the deep Golden Knights, who went efficiently through the playoffs, winning their title in 22 games.

Congratulations to Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark on winning the 2023 Tour de France for the second year in a row. With this title, Jonas becomes the first Danish rider to win the Tour de France twice, surpassing  Bjarne Riis, who won back in 1996. As Vingegaard and Jumbo-Visma celebrate deep into the Parisian night, we ask the question...how did Jonas Vingegaard win the Tour de France?

It's all about the climbs.

The Tour de France is the most prominent cycling race in the world. It‚Äôs now in its 109th edition and it‚Äôs being called the ‚ÄòHighest in History‚Äô because there are more climbs than ever before. This is important because the climbs are where the race is won and lost. The best riders rely on their teammates to get them through the long, flat, and hilly stages, before they take on the mountain stages on their own. These are the hardest and most brutal stages of the race - but they are exactly what makes the Tour de France famous.

Highlights from stage 9 of the Tour de France 2023. The iconic Puy de D√¥me returns to the Tour de France for the first time in 35 years. Starting in Saint-L√©onard-de-Noblat, the stage is 182.4km long with 3,611m of climbing. The final climb up Puy de D√¥me (13.3km at 7.7%) is very narrow and devilishly steep, averaging almost 12% for the final 4km.

Each swimming event is broken up into rounds with the purpose of trimming the field of competitors (which can sometimes number upwards of 90+ for individual events) down to a final race of eight. Individual events at distances of 200m and shorter require three rounds: preliminary heats, semifinals, and a final. Each athlete participates in one of several preliminary heats in hopes of recording a top-16 time, thereby advancing to the semifinals.  

From there, the eight fastest swimmers across both semifinal heats advance to the final. Individual events at distances of 400m or longer, along with all relay events, do not include a semifinal round. In these events, only the top eight swimmers or teams across the preliminary heats advance to the final. In the event of a tie for the final lane in a semifinal or final round, tied competitors swim an additional head-to-head race to determine who advances. This is also known as a ""swim off"". Olympic swimming competition days generally contain two sessions: one for only preliminary heats, and a second for semifinals and finals. The exceptions are the first day of competition, which lacks a semifinal/final session, and the last day, which does not contain a heats session.

 Highlights as USA's Katie Ledecky wins Gold in the Women's 800m Freestyle during the London 2012 Olympic Games. 

Swimming has featured on the programme of all editions of the Games since 1896. The very first Olympic events were freestyle (crawl) or breaststroke. Backstroke was added in 1904.

In the 1940s, breaststrokers discovered that they could go faster by bringing both arms forward over their heads. This practice was immediately forbidden in breaststroke, but gave birth to butterfly, whose first official appearance was at the 1956 Games in Melbourne. This style is now one of the four strokes used in competition.

Women's swimming became Olympic in 1912 at the Stockholm Games. Since then, it has been part of every edition of the Games. The men's and women's programmes are almost identical, as they contain the same number of events, with only one difference: the freestyle distance is 800 metres for women and 1,500 metres for men.

üìú Story: 
In this heartwarming and inspiring video, we look at the incredible journey of Eric Moussambani Malonga, an Equatoguinean swimmer nicknamed "Eric the Eel." Join us as we dive into the story of his unlikely victory in the Summer event, where he swam the 100m freestyle in a record-breaking slow time of 1:52.72. Despite never having seen a Professional-sized swimming pool and having limited access to training facilities, Eric's determination and spirit won him the heat after both competitors were disqualified. Although he didn't advance to the next round, he set a new personal best and a national record for Equatorial Guinea. Watch as we explore how Eric's journey inspired a nation and led to his appointment as coach of the national swimming squad, becoming a symbol of resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity.

In the thrilling finale of the 100m butterfly event at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, Michael Phelps left the world awestruck with an astonishingly close finish. As the race reached its climax, Phelps engaged in an intense battle with Serbian swimmer Milorad ƒåaviƒá. Stroke by stroke, they surged toward the wall, both determined to touch it first. With hearts pounding and spectators holding their breath, the outcome remained uncertain until the very last moment. 

In the end, Phelps managed to stretch his arm ever so slightly ahead, clinching victory by a mere hundredth of a second. This nail-biting race etched its place in history as one of the closest swimming finishes ever witnessed, solidifying Michael Phelps' legendary status in the world of competitive swimming.

Nina Kennedy has restored Australian supremacy in the Commonwealth Games women‚Äôs pole vault with a dominant display in Birmingham. 

Two weeks after hanging tough to win the bronze medal at the world championships in Eugene, Oregon, USA, Kennedy did it much easier at Alexander Stadium. 

Her winning height of 4.60m was 20cm less than what was required to claim third spot at the world titles. 

Australians have now won the women‚Äôs pole vault on six of the seven occasions it has been competing at the Commonwealth Games, a sequence broken only when Canadian Alysha Newman won four years ago, ironically, on the Gold Coast. 

Newman was forced to pull out of the 2022 Commonwealth Games Competition early because of a leg injury.
 
Tokyo‚Äôs Olympics bronze medalist Holly Bradshaw from England also withdrew from the competition due to injuries she suffered at the world championship in Eugene, Oregon when her pole snapped in mid-vault.  There was no-one left in the field with a personal best anywhere near Kennedy‚Äôs 4.82m. 

It was pretty much as they would say a one-horse race, and so it proved. 

Kennedy seemed very confident when she cleared 4.50m; that was more than enough to clinch the gold medal, but she kept jumping.  She soared over 4.60m on her second attempt. 

To the delight of the crowd, Kennedy defied tricky windy conditions to then have three unsuccessful cracks at what would have been a new Commonwealth record of 4.76m. 

Molly Caudery from England claimed the silver on countback ahead of New Zealand‚Äôs Imogen Ayris after both cleared 4.45m.
